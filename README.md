# Brendon didn't gave a name, Madiator called LBRYgrabber, I call LBRYseeds, help us with the name

[Brendon Brewer](https://open.lbry.com/@BrendonBrewer:3?r=FkXuBKiec1TjrEKg6zLLWoD2Gq1pYpgk) wrote a [Python code](https://open.lbry.com/@BrendonBrewer:3/channel-download:8?r=FkXuBKiec1TjrEKg6zLLWoD2Gq1pYpgk) which you can use to download all content from a LBRY channel. You might want to do this for seeding your favorite channels or friends. 


[Check Brendon's original code](https://open.lbry.com/@BrendonBrewer:3/channel-download:8?r=FkXuBKiec1TjrEKg6zLLWoD2Gq1pYpgk)

I modified so I only downloads only the blobs of the file so it doesn't takes much space from your computer (thanks to @eukrein that rescue me from non-sense complex solutions to a simple boolean switch tip) and then made executable for the Windows user :) I also added a call to ```lbrynet.exe``` to make sure its running while the script is working.  Let the seed season begin!

>OBS.: The best way to use it is to run the original Brendon's script, **that works in any O.S. with python**, this version is for windows users that doesn't know how to run python scripts :) 
>The seeding only works if you have lbrynet on or your Lbry desktop App on

Also thanks @madiator for the introduction in pyinstaller

## What does it do ? 

You can download the most recent [blobs](https://lbry.com/faq/host-content),   from your favorite channels and help to **seed** then over LBRY network.
Just type a channels name and wait for blobs download. Don't worry about space blobfile are 2Mb , Lets SEED each other and improve the user experience for everyone! You can also choose a number of posts to download or you can download the entire chosen channel !!

### How to Download and run it.

As you can see in the video below you have to reach Brendon's head in ```\dist``` folder

### If you think its necessary a Mac OS or Linux Version comment below, but its really recommended that you learn how to run python script and its really cool to interact with lbrynet through the API
